# Detection_heart_decision

Project Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate various machine learning models for the detection of heart disease. Utilizing a dataset comprised of clinical and physiological parameters, models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Neural Network have been applied and assessed for their performance.

Installation:

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1.	Clone the repository:
https://github.com/drashti2607/Detection_heart_decision.git
 
2.	Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the kaggle and includes features like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure among others. 

Models:

This project includes the following machine learning models:
  *	K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
  *	Decision Tree
  *	Logistic Regression
  *	Random Forest
  *	Neural Network
    
The models are implemented using the sklearn library, and the neural network is built with tensorflow.

Results:

The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, and recall. Summary of the results:
  *	KNN: Improved accuracy from 66% to 70%
  *	Decision Tree: Highest accuracy of 92%
  *	Logistic Regression: Improved to 84.44%
  *	Random Forest: Consistently 100%
  *	Neural Network: Achieved 83.60% accuracy
  
Future Work:

Future enhancements will focus on integrating more complex models, exploring real-time data implementation, and expanding the dataset to include more diverse demographics.
